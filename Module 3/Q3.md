    pthread_exit(NULL); 
}

int main(){
    pthread_t hthd, wthd;
    pthread_create(&hthd, NULL, hello, NULL);
    pthread_create(&wthd, NULL, world, NULL);
    
    pthread_join(hthd, NULL);
    pthread_join(wthd, NULL);

## Question 7: What is the difference between exec and fork?

**Answer: fork is used for process creation.
          exec is used for program execution within an existing process.**

## Question 8: What is the difference between process and threads?

**Answer: Process -> These are independent execution unit. They by default contain a thread, and many threads can be created in a process. They've independent resource allocation.
          Thread -> These are process dependent execution unit. They share resources from different threads in the same process. Due to this synchronization is required.**
